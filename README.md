# Personal Terminal Text Editor TUI Like Vim

My goal with this project is to learn Go and for this purpose a project is suitable for me to be able to gain practical experience.
Why Go?
Because it can be used for web development as well as hardware-related programming, since I have to manipulate the terminal for this project.
For me, this is a perfect combination.

These Go projects inspired me to write my own editor.
